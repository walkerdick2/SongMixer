# SongMixer
Have you seen the incredibly popular 'Google Translate Sings *x* song videos on Youtube?
Yes?
Have you ever wanted to make a video like that on your own?
## Well now you can!
    Using the python program you can input a Song (and Artist) and it will feed the lyrics through the Google Translate api and (most likely) spit out a completely unrealted song.


To use the program simply run it and input a song and artist(not requred) and wait while it works it's magic.

It will then output a text file with the format song-artist-Mixified with the crazy mixed up lyrics.

Thank's for your intrest.
